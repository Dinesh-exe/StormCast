Task: Build a Weather and News Aggregator App with Weather-Based News
Filtering
Objective: Develop an app using Flutter and Dart that fetches and displays weather information
and news headlines using publicly available APIs. The app should include a unique logic to filter
news based on the weather.
Requirements:
1. User Interface:
○ A home screen displaying weather information and news headlines.
○ A settings screen where users can manage their preferences.
2. Features:
○ Weather Information:

■ Display temperature, weather conditions, and a five-day forecast.
■ Use a publicly available weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
○ News Headlines:
■ Fetch the latest news headlines.
■ Display headlines, brief descriptions, and links to full articles.
■ Use a publicly available news API (e.g., NewsAPI).
○ Weather-Based News Filtering:
■ Implement logic to filter news based on the current weather:
■ If the weather is cold, show only depressing news headlines.
■ If the weather is hot, show news articles related to fear.
■ If the weather is cool, show news articles about winning and
happiness.
○ Settings:
■ Allow users to select their preferred units for temperature
(Celsius/Fahrenheit).
■ Enable users to select news categories they are interested in.
3. Technical Specifications:
○ Use Flutter for front-end development.
○ Use Dart as the programming language.
○ State management using Provider or Riverpod.
○ Fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
○ Fetch news headlines using the NewsAPI.
○ Ensure the app has a responsive design to support different screen sizes.
